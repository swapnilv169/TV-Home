The three layouts show TV Home 4.9; the unchanged screensaver and theme picker are earlier captures. All are from a Fire TV Stick HD with weather and location hidden. Wallpapers and third-party apps shown are not bundled.

## What you get

- **Three designs:** Classic, Cinema and Panel; switch on the TV or from your phone.
- **Your own look:** separate wallpapers and optional elements for each design, wallpaper rotation, a custom Home name and animation controls.
- **Organized apps:** favorites, ordering, hidden apps and an app library.
- **Everyday controls:** Cast, Settings, supported TV inputs, Sleep and Restart.
- **Weather and idle screen:** optional city weather, a wallpaper screensaver with its own optional image and swipe animation, and Home-only idle sleep.
- **Device care:** optional reversible cleanup, update restrictions, restore points and Home-switching repair.

<summary><strong>All launcher features</strong></summary>

| Feature | What you can do |
| --- | --- |
| **Classic** | Up to six favorites above all other visible apps; no separate All apps button. Rounded artwork with mint focus outlines. |
| **Cinema** | Up to six favorites in one dock, followed by a **More apps** tile. A shared dock contains the remaining apps. Bold centered clock and caption above the main dock. |
| **Panel** | All visible apps alphabetically, without favorites or an All apps button. Power, a bold centered clock, and connection/storage information live in the sidebar. |
| Cinema dock appearance | Choose wallpaper blur, dark shade or light shade in phone theme options or **TV → Customize → Dock appearance**. Both Cinema docks use the same choice. Blur uses a cached 160-pixel-wide wallpaper sample; shades skip blur allocation/processing. |
| Theme switching | Choose a design from **TV → Customize → Themes** or explicitly apply it in the phone app. One APK includes all three designs; only one is active. |
| Independent theme settings | Each design remembers its wallpapers, rotation, optional elements and animation setting. Editing an inactive design does not switch the TV. Reset a design's options without deleting its wallpapers. |
| Your Home name | Replace “HOME” with your own name, shared across the three layouts and the phone app. |
| Wallpapers | Upload your own JPEG, PNG or WebP images; use up to eight per design, automatic rotation or **Next wallpaper** on the TV. Recommended: **1920 × 1080, 16:9 landscape**. 4K imports are resized; other shapes are center-cropped. No wallpaper is bundled. |
| Optional elements | Show or hide the clock, greeting, weather, connection/free-space status, Cast and Power for each design. Turn focus and screensaver animations on or off. |
| App library and favorites | Open user-facing TV apps and supported preinstalled apps, pin up to six favorites for Classic/Cinema, reorder them left/right and remove favorites. Hold OK or press Menu on an app for its options. Internal system screens are filtered; usable built-in apps such as Silk remain available. |
| Hidden apps | Hide apps from Home and bring them back through Hidden apps or the phone. Hiding does not uninstall or disable them. Open an app's system settings from its menu. |
| Remote navigation | Navigate with the TV remote's D-pad and OK. Back clears the selection or returns to Home; the heading changes to the selected app name and returns to its greeting when no app is selected. |
| Weather | Choose a city or leave weather Off. Cached forecasts, Celsius/Fahrenheit, a manual refresh option and per-theme visibility. No automatic IP-location lookup. |
| Wallpaper storage | Removed theme images are reclaimed after a successful save; stale uploads are cleaned safely. Phone **Themes → Remove unused wallpapers** removes unreferenced images. Saved themes, the separate screensaver and recovery references are protected. |
| Configuration recovery | Invalid saved settings are preserved and reported. Restore a last-known-good configuration or explicitly reset before editing again. |
| Wallpaper screensaver | Choose the active theme’s wallpaper or upload a separate screensaver image shared across all designs. On Home only, show that image, bold clock, weekday, date and optional city weather after two idle minutes. Brief slide-up entrance and upward swipe dismissal; subtle text-position changes once per minute. The first key dismisses without opening an app. |
| Idle and power | Sleep after fifteen idle minutes on Home, or use manual **Sleep** / **Restart** from Power. Turn the Home idle screen off from TV Customize or phone Themes. Other apps keep their own playback/idle behavior; global Fire OS timeouts are unchanged. |
| Cast, Settings and network | Open Fire TV Display Mirroring, system Settings or network settings directly from Home. Availability depends on the device. |
| TV inputs | Show an Inputs menu for supported integrated TVs. Choose automatic detection, always show or hide; sticks normally have no TV inputs to expose. |
| Home selection and recovery | Switch between **Default home** and **This home**, with shared Home-button/Back-return handling, startup and wake recovery across all layouts. The phone provides a Home-switching repair action. |
| Lightweight rendering | Native Java views, asynchronous app/artwork and wallpaper loading, cached configuration and weather, no video wallpaper or continuous screensaver animation. Hidden Home releases its drawing surface and pauses idle work while another app is in front. |

<summary><strong>All phone app and computer-tool features</strong></summary>

- **Phone updates:** quietly check the latest stable GitHub release on launch, at most once a day. An available update appears in the app; **Check for app updates** checks immediately. Downloads open the official release page and installation requires your normal Android approval.
- **Running apps:** refresh the process list under **Apps** and stop an eligible app individually after confirmation. This list can include foreground and cached processes; it is not a RAM-usage meter or an automatic cleaner. On the TV, **Manage apps** opens system app details for manual management.
- **Install or update the launcher** over authorized ADB on your local network. The phone APK contains the matching TV APK and sets up the required Home-switching permissions.
- **Customize without reinstalling:** switch designs, upload wallpapers, change element visibility, set your Home name and city, manage favorites/hidden apps, and toggle the idle screen.
- **Reversible cleanup:** select optional system extras to disable or re-enable. The tool records their original states; it does not uninstall packages or clear app data.
- **Update controls:** restrict known Amazon updater components or resume access. Fire OS can protect those components, so this is best effort, not a guaranteed OTA block. Router/DNS settings are not changed.
- **Restore points:** save, export and import the recorded baseline; restore changes made by Studio and review change history. Apps and their data are retained. Wallpaper image files are not backed up; missing images are skipped during settings restoration.
- **Manual computer workflow:** Python + ADB installation, theme/Home selection, status, Home repair, selected cleanup and restoration. The Python helper needs only the standard library.
- **Privacy:** no project accounts, ads or analytics. ADB authorization keys and restore points stay in local app storage. Weather uses Open-Meteo only when a city is selected. No phone remote-control clone is included.

## Things to know

- **Amazon Home can still appear** before the service starts or during some system transitions. It stays enabled for Settings and recovery; this is not a guaranteed zero-flash replacement.
- Update restrictions and Cast/Inputs/Power actions depend on Fire OS permissions and device support.
- The reported return to Amazon’s screensaver remains under investigation. The existing 15-minute sleep fallback releases keep-awake if sleep cannot be requested; focus loss also returns control to Fire OS. Sleep/wake/power behavior is unchanged in this source update.
- Bright or static wallpapers are not burn-in protection. The screensaver runs only on our Home; other apps keep their own playback/idle behavior.

<details>
<summary><strong>How Home return works and its limitations</strong></summary>

The launcher avoids the old timed handoff between two Home windows. It detects app-initiated Home returns, including Back from YouTube, prepares for wake and starts a lightweight cover while the full launcher loads at boot. All themes use the same routing.

**Amazon Home can still appear before Fire OS connects our service, or after a service/permission failure or some system transitions.** This is not a zero-flash guarantee. Amazon Home stays enabled for Settings and recovery; there is no root or firmware patch.

Sleep, Restart, Cast and Inputs depend on the TV's firmware and permissions. The wallpaper screensaver is not burn-in protection: bright/static wallpapers can still retain imagery. No universal performance or movie-length playback guarantee is claimed.
